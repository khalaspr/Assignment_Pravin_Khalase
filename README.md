Silent features

1. Implemented factory design pattern, we will have factory of size, version and so on if another product comes we can inherit from typechecker. Hence it is open for extension.

Based on the type the product will be instantiated. And we will get the actual version or size depending upon the command line parameters e.g. type.

2. I have written 2 unit test method one for size and other for version.

3. Added assembly of thirdpartytools in fileData project.

4. Set the command parameters in properties-> Debug screen.
